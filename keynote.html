    Linus Torvalds
    As the creator of the Linux operating system, Linus Torvalds has been a driving force behind the whole open source
    movement, which represents not only an ever increasing challenge to proprietary software, but is also the
    inspiration for the industry to move to open standards.

    Torvalds remains the ultimate authority on what new code is incorporated into the Linux kernel.

        <h4>James Gosling</h4><br>
        <p>
            James Gosling is a software developer best known for his participation in the development of the popular Java
            programming language. Gosling is generally credited with creating the original Java design, and implementing the
            original compiler and virtual machine. Though he started his career with Sun Microsystems, Gosling left the
            company when it was acquired by the Oracle Corporation, citing the “ethical challenges” of remaining. In 2011, he
            was hired by Google, but left five months later to join the start-up Liquid Robotics. In 2002, Gosling was
            awarded The Economist Innovation Award, and in 2007, he was named an Officer in the Order of Canada, the second
            highest civilian honor.<br>

        <p>
            Finnish-born Linus Torvalds is the creator of Linux, a popular open source operating system. Linux has been
            adapted into thousands of variations, and many web servers run using the system. Torvalds, who currently acts as
            Linux’s project coordinator, is also the creator of Git, a revision control system, and Subsurface, a diving log
            software. In 2012, Torvalds was honored by the Technology Academy Finland with the Millennium Technology Prize in
            recognition of his creation of the Linux kernel.<br>

        <p>
            Mark Zuckberg is the American computer programmer and internet entrepreneur responsible for developing Facebook
            in his Harvard dorm room. Facebook, Inc., for which Zuckerberg currently serves as CEO, has continued to grow
            exponentially since Zuckerberg first moved the company to Palo Alto, California. The social media website currently
            boasts over 1 billion users worldwide. Every year since 2010, Time magazine has included Zuckerberg on their lists
            of the 100 wealthiest people, most influential people, and as part of their annual Person of the Year feature.
            Though his official salary as CEO of Facebook is exactly $1, Zuckerberg’s personal wealth is estimated at $33.1

        <h4>Tim Berners-Lee</h4><br>
        <p>
            Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist who has single-handedly changed the course of human history.
            In 1989, he proposed a new information management system. A mere eight months later, he received the first
            successful communication from a Hypertext Transfer Protocol via the internet. Since then, Berners-Lee’s initial
            proposal, the World Wide Web, has become a vital part of nearly every household, business, school, and government
            in the world. In 2012, he was honored as the official inventor of the internet at the Olympics Opening Ceremony in
            London. During the ceremony, he live tweeted “This is for everyone,” words which were instantly spelled out in LCD
            lights attached to chairs in the crowd. Berners-Lee is currently the director of the World Wide Web Consortium
            (W3C), through which he oversees the internet’s continued development.<br>

        <h4>Sergey Brin</h4><br>
        <p>
            Sergey Brin is the co-founder of Google, one of the most profitable internet companies of all time. He is an
            American computer scientist who emigrated from the Soviet Union at age six. As a PhD student at Stanford University,
            Brin and his friend, Larry Page, crammed a bunch of cheap computers into their dorm room and developed Brin’s data
            mining system. The mining system became so popular at Stanford, that the two eventually decided to drop out, rent a
            garage, and start Google. Since then, Brin’s personal wealth has been estimated at more than $32 million. The
            Economist has declared Brin an “Enlightened Man,” which is an appropriate title considering Google’s mission
            statement has always included the idea that “knowledge is always good, and certainly better than ignorance.”<br>
