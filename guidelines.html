<p>
    Authors should submit an extended abstract, as well as a brief informal description of their paper. All submitted<br>
    materials will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Extended abstract:</b><br>
    The extended abstract should contain a scholarly exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including motivation<br>
    and a clear comparison with related work. The body of the extended abstract should not exceed ten (10) letter-sized<br>
    pages (not including the bibliography, figures, and appendix) using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column <br>
    format with ample spacing and 1-inch margins all around. Authors are expected to include all the ideas necessary for<br>
    an expert to verify the central claims in the paper.  If necessary, proofs may appear in a clearly marked appendix.<br>
    However, any material not included in the body may be ignored at the discretion of the Program Committee. Abstracts<br>
    deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.<br>
    The extended abstract should be self-contained, and not rely on the brief description.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Brief description:</b><br>
    Ideally, the brief description should be an informal description of the most interesting ideas in the paper. The <br>
    contents may range all the way from a discussion of the conceptual contributions of the paper, to a sketch of the<br>
    key ideas in the proof of the simplest non-trivial statement of the main result. In other words, the brief<br>
    description should provide the same understanding conveyed in a brief conversation or presentation. The brief <br>
    description should be no more than two pages, using the same font size, margins and spacing as the extended abstract.<br>
    It may replicate material from the extended abstract, or even be a copy of its first two pages.  But, it must not<br>
    contain any technical material not present in the extended abstract.
