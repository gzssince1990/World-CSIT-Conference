<h1>Welcome to TOPCS conference!</h1>

<p style = "width: 50%; text-align: center;">
    This conference is committed to provide a vibrant scientific platform where eminent authors, academicians, researchers,
    scholars and industry persons will get a chance to present their latest research works and share their thoughts for
    future developments of emerging technologies, systems, protocols and algorithms on Information Systems, Communications
    and Control theory. During the last few decades, a continuous and revolutionize advancements have been seen in
    Information and computer science with the development of latest computing protocols and algorithms. Especially, the
    developments have been visualized in computer networks, computer vision and machine learning areas. Besides,
    evolutionary computing and bio-inspired models have attracted many attentions due to its dynamic representation and
    analysis of complex neurobiological data. Communication systems have proven potential to provide a wide range of useful
    services and evolving technologies through implementations and innovations of communication networks, radio transmission
    systems, fiber-optic communication, power line communication, energy transmission and data terminal equipments. Here,
    signal processing plays a vital role to shape-up various communication technologies to fulfill the world-wide demands
    of finest and more accurate systems.In electrical and instrumentation engineering, control system is a very traditional
    working field which is used to regulate the behaviors of other devices and machines. In addition, the applications of
    power systems, bio-medical instruments, high voltage technology, transducers and sensors are rapidly growing and making
    their presence in industrial developments.
